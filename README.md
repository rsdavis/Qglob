# Qglob
Qglob is a command-line utility written in python and designed to automate many of the repetitive tasks associated with preparing extensive computational data sets.

Qglob is a really fun project of mine that I have been tuning throughout years of computational research to remove some of the mindnumbing and error-prone repetition from my daily worklife. While it is less than 100 lines of python, it is very useful in its ability to glob together many directories and perform similar (yet different) functions in each directory according to regular expressions inputted through the command line. For more details on how to use Qglob, see my post at my [website](http://rsdavis.mycpanel.princeton.edu/wp/?p=11).
